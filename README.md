'''
Foundation — Days 1–25 (Basics & essentials)

Goal: Comfortable with environment, syntax, core data types, plotting, and basic algorithms.
Weeks 1–2 (Days 1–14)

MATLAB environment, scripts vs functions, workspace, path

Variables, arrays, matrices, indexing, logicals

Basic plotting: plot, scatter, hist, imagesc, saving figures

File I/O: load/save, text read/write, CSV, basic debugging

Weeks 3–4 (Days 15–25)

Control flow: for, while, if, switch

Functions, variable scope, nargin/nargout, anonymous functions

Vectorization and performance basics (preallocation, avoiding loops)

Intro to built-in toolboxes (Signal, Image, Statistics basics overview)
Mini project (A): Data cleaner & visualizer — import messy CSV, clean, compute stats, produce publication-quality plots and an automated PDF report.

Intermediate — Days 26–60 (Deeper tools & applied skills)

Goal: Build algorithms, use toolboxes, GUIs, and introduce real-time concepts.
Weeks 5–8 (Days 26–44)

Advanced matrix ops, eigen/svd applications, least squares

Signal processing basics: filters, FFT, windowing

Image processing basics: filtering, edge detection, morphological ops

Data fitting, curve fitting, interpolation

Weeks 9–13 (Days 45–60)

ODE solving, numerical integration, optimization (fmincon, lsqnonlin)

Object-oriented basics in MATLAB (classes, handles)

Simple GUI with App Designer; callbacks and state handling
Project (B): Interactive instrument dashboard — small App Designer GUI that plots live simulated sensor readings, allows filtering and exporting data.

Advanced — Days 61–90 (Real-time, parallel, ML & system integration)

Goal: Real-time-ish workflows, acceleration, ML basics, hardware interfacing concepts.
Weeks 14–17 (Days 61–74)

Parallel computing basics (parfor, spmd), profiling for speed

Machine Learning fundamentals with MATLAB: feature extraction, classifiers, cross-validation

Advanced plotting, animation, publishing code and reports

Weeks 18–20 (Days 75–90)

Real-time simulation patterns (timers, streaming data, buffering)

Hardware IO concepts (serial, TCP/IP, MATLAB Support Package notions) — simulated if hardware unavailable

Deploying models: generating standalone functions, mex, or codegen basics
Project (C — Mind-blowing #1): Real-time Face-Aware Watchdog

What: Live webcam (or simulated stream) face detection → classify expression using a trained model → overlay indicators and log events in real time.

Skills shown: Image processing, ML classification, streaming buffers, App Designer UI, code optimization.

Deliverable: App that runs live (or plays recorded stream) with low latency and event export.

Capstone & polish — Days 91–100 (Final projects, deployment, portfolio)

Goal: Complete capstones, prepare presentations, optimize and document.
Days 91–95 — finalize Projects C & D; code review and performance tuning.
Days 96–98 — finalize Project E; create README, video demo (30–60s), and report.
Days 99–100 — portfolio website or PDF compilation; practice demo talk.

Project (D — Mind-blowing #2): Autonomous Drone Navigation Simulator

What: Simulated 2D/3D environment where a virtual drone navigates obstacles using sensor fusion (simulated LIDAR + camera), planning, and PID control.

Skills shown: Simulation, control systems, sensor fusion algorithms, visualization, codegen-ready structure for real embedded pipeline.

Deliverable: Interactive simulation with recorded mission logs and failure/recovery scenarios.

Project (E — Mind-blowing #3, Capstone): Smart Factory Digital Twin

What: A compact “digital twin” of a factory line: simulated machines, queueing, predictive maintenance using anomaly detection, and dashboard control. Real-time alarms trigger simulated maintenance routines.

Skills shown: Systems integration, time-series anomaly detection, queuing logic, dashboards, automated reporting.

Deliverable: Web/exportable dashboard, anomaly detector model, scenario scripts showing ROI metrics.

Project (optional smaller) — Project (B) referenced earlier; Project A small, Project B interactive dashboard.

Summary of projects:

A (small): Data cleaner & visualizer (early)

B (mid): Interactive instrument dashboard (intermediate)

C (big): Real-time Face-Aware Watchdog (advanced, mind-blowing)

D (big): Autonomous Drone Navigation Simulator (advanced, mind-blowing)

E (capstone): Smart Factory Digital Twin (capstone, mind-blowing)
